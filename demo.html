<h1><b>welcome to world of cyberspace</b></h1>
<p><i>Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. 
It's also known as information technology security or electronic information security.
The term applies in a variety of contexts, from business to mobile computing, and can be divided into a few common categories.</i></p>
<h2 align="center">scale of the cyberthreat</h2>
<p><i>The global cyber threat continues to evolve at a rapid pace, with a rising number of data breaches each year. 
A report by RiskBased Security revealed that a shocking 7.9 billion records have been exposed by data breaches in the first nine months of 2019 alone.
 This figure is more than double (112%) the number of records exposed in the same period in 2018</i></p>
 <p><i>The importance of system monitoring is echoed in the “10 steps to cyber security”, guidance provided by the U.K. government’s National Cyber Security Centre. 
 In Australia, TheAustralian Cyber Security Centre(ACSC) regularly publishes guidance on how organizations can counter the latest cyber-security threats. </i></p>
 <h2>Malware</h2>
 <p><i>Malware means malicious software.One of the most common cyber threats, malware is software that a cybercriminal or hacker has created to disrupt or damage a legitimate user’s computer.
  Often spread via an unsolicited email attachment or legitimate-looking download, malware may be used by cybercriminals to make money or in politically motivated cyber-attacks.</i></p>
  <h2><b>What is a cyberspace?</b></h2>
  <p><i>Cyberspace refers to the virtual computer world, and more specifically, an electronic medium that is used to facilitate online communication. 
  Cyberspace typically involves a large computer network made up of many worldwide computer subnetworks that employ TCP/IP protocol to aid in communication and data exchange activities.
